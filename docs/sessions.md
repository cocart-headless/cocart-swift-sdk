# Sessions API

A **session** represents a single shopping cart — either a guest visitor's cart or a logged-in customer's cart. The server keeps track of all active sessions so that each visitor gets their own cart. This page covers two things:

1. **Admin Sessions Endpoint** — For store administrators to view and manage all active cart sessions.
2. **Storage Adapters** — How the SDK persists guest cart keys across app launches.

## Admin Sessions Endpoint

The Sessions endpoint is for administrators to manage cart sessions server-side. It requires WooCommerce REST API credentials (see [Consumer Keys](authentication.md#consumer-keys-admin)).

```swift
import CoCart

let client = CoCart("https://your-store.com", options: CoCartOptions(
    consumerKey: "ck_xxxxx",
    consumerSecret: "cs_xxxxx"
))
```

### List All Sessions

```swift
let response = try await client.sessions().all()

// With parameters
let response = try await client.sessions().all(["per_page": "50"])
```

### Find a Session

```swift
// By cart key
let response = try await client.sessions().get("guest_abc123")
```

### Delete a Session

```swift
let response = try await client.sessions().delete("guest_abc123")
```

### Delete All Sessions

```swift
let response = try await client.sessions().deleteAll()
```

## Storage Adapters

A **storage adapter** is a small class that knows how to save and retrieve data. The SDK needs storage to persist things like cart keys so they survive app restarts. Different environments need different storage strategies:

- **Production** — Uses the Keychain to securely save data that persists across app launches.
- **Tests / SwiftUI Previews** — Uses in-memory storage so tests are isolated and don't touch the Keychain.

All storage adapters conform to the same `CoCartStorage` protocol, so you can swap them freely.

### KeychainStorage

The default storage adapter. Uses Apple's Keychain Services to securely store cart keys and other sensitive data. Data is encrypted at rest by the operating system and persists across app launches, device reboots, and app updates.

```swift
// Used automatically — no configuration needed
let client = CoCart("https://your-store.com")

// Or configure with a custom service identifier
let storage = KeychainStorage(service: "com.myapp.cocart")
let client = CoCart("https://your-store.com", options: CoCartOptions(storage: storage))
```

### MemoryStorage

Stores data in the application's memory. Data is lost when the app is terminated. Best for unit tests and SwiftUI previews where you need isolated, predictable behavior.

```swift
import CoCart

let storage = MemoryStorage()
let client = CoCart("https://your-store.com", options: CoCartOptions(storage: storage))
```

### Custom Storage

If the built-in adapters don't fit your needs, you can create your own. Just conform to the `CoCartStorage` protocol — it defines three methods: `read`, `write`, and `delete`:

```swift
import CoCart

class UserDefaultsStorage: CoCartStorage {
    func read(_ key: String) async throws -> String? {
        UserDefaults.standard.string(forKey: key)
    }

    func write(_ key: String, value: String) async throws {
        UserDefaults.standard.set(value, forKey: key)
    }

    func delete(_ key: String) async throws {
        UserDefaults.standard.removeObject(forKey: key)
    }
}
```

The protocol supports both synchronous and asynchronous implementations via `async throws`.

## Guest Session Lifecycle

This is one of the most important flows in headless e-commerce. A visitor shops as a guest (no account needed), fills up their cart, then decides to log in or create an account. You want their guest cart items to carry over to their customer cart — otherwise they'd lose everything and have to start over. Here's the full flow:

```swift
import CoCart

let client = CoCart("https://your-store.com")

// 1. Restore previous session on app launch
try await client.restoreSession()

// 2. If no previous session, guest browses and adds items
try await client.cart().addItem(123, quantity: 2)
try await client.cart().addItem(456, quantity: 1)
print(client.cartKey) // Optional("guest_abc123...")

// 3. Guest decides to log in (cart transfers to customer account)
try await client.login("customer@email.com", password: "password")

// 4. Guest cart items are now in the customer's cart
let cart = try await client.cart().get()
let items = cart.getItems() // Contains items 123 and 456

// 5. Later, customer logs out
try await client.logout()

// 6. Clear the session
try await client.clearSession()
```
