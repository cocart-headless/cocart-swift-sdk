# Products API

The Products API lets you browse your store's catalog — listing products, searching, filtering by category or price, and reading product details. It is publicly accessible and does not require authentication, just like a customer browsing your store's shelves.

```swift
let products = client.products()
```

## List Products

```swift
let response = try await client.products().all()
let response = try await client.products().all(["per_page": "20", "page": "1"])
```

## Parameters Reference

**Query parameters** are options you send alongside a request to filter or control the results. They are appended to the URL as `?key=value` pairs. The SDK handles this for you — just pass a dictionary with the parameters you want.

All list methods accept an optional `params` dictionary with these query parameters:

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `page` | int | Page number (default: 1) |
| `per_page` | int | Items per page (default: 10, max: 100) |
| `search` | string | Search term |
| `category` | string | Filter by category slug |
| `tag` | string | Filter by tag slug |
| `status` | string | Product status |
| `featured` | bool | Show only featured products |
| `on_sale` | bool | Show only products on sale |
| `min_price` | string | Minimum price |
| `max_price` | string | Maximum price |
| `stock_status` | string | Stock status (`instock`, `outofstock`, `onbackorder`) |
| `orderby` | string | Sort field (`date`, `id`, `title`, `slug`, `price`, `popularity`, `rating`) |
| `order` | string | Sort direction (`asc`, `desc`) |

## Filtering

### By Category

```swift
let response = try await client.products().all(["category": "electronics"])

// With additional params
let response = try await client.products().all([
    "category": "electronics",
    "per_page": "20",
    "orderby": "price",
    "order": "asc"
])
```

### Featured Products

```swift
let response = try await client.products().all(["featured": "true"])
let response = try await client.products().all(["featured": "true", "per_page": "4"])
```

### Products on Sale

```swift
let response = try await client.products().all(["on_sale": "true"])
```

### By Price Range

```swift
// Products between $10 and $50
let response = try await client.products().all(["min_price": "10", "max_price": "50"])

// Products under $25
let response = try await client.products().all(["max_price": "25"])

// Products over $100
let response = try await client.products().all(["min_price": "100"])
```

### Search

```swift
let response = try await client.products().all(["search": "wireless headphones"])

// Search within a category
let response = try await client.products().all([
    "search": "headphones",
    "category": "electronics"
])
```

### Combining Filters

```swift
let response = try await client.products().all([
    "category": "clothing",
    "on_sale": "true",
    "min_price": "20",
    "max_price": "100",
    "orderby": "popularity",
    "order": "desc",
    "per_page": "12"
])
```

### By Stock Status

```swift
let response = try await client.products().all(["stock_status": "instock"])
let response = try await client.products().all(["stock_status": "outofstock"])
let response = try await client.products().all(["stock_status": "onbackorder"])
```

## Single Product

### By ID

```swift
let response = try await client.products().get(123)

print(response.getString("name"))
print(response.getString("price"))
print(response.getString("description"))
```

## Variations

**Variations** are the specific versions of a variable product. For example, a T-shirt product might have variations for "Red / Small", "Red / Large", "Blue / Small", etc. Each variation has its own price, stock level, and SKU.

### List All Variations

```swift
let response = try await client.products().variations(123)
```

### Get a Specific Variation

```swift
let response = try await client.products().variation(123, variationID: 456)
```

## Categories

### List All Categories

```swift
let response = try await client.products().categories()
let response = try await client.products().categories(["per_page": "50"])
```

## Tags

### List All Tags

```swift
let response = try await client.products().tags()
```

## Attributes

**Attributes** are the properties that define product variations — things like "Color", "Size", or "Material". Each attribute has **terms** (the specific values), such as "Red", "Blue", "Green" for a "Color" attribute. Attributes are configured in WooCommerce under Products > Attributes.

### List All Attributes

```swift
let response = try await client.products().attributes()
```

## Reviews

### Reviews for a Specific Product

```swift
let response = try await client.products().reviews(123)
```

## Working with Responses

All methods return a `CoCartResponse`:

```swift
let response = try await client.products().all(["per_page": "5"])

// Access nested data with dot notation
let response = try await client.products().get(123)
print(response.getString("name"))
print(response.getString("price"))
print(response.getString("categories.0.name"))

// Full data as dictionary
let data = response.toDictionary()

// Decode into your own Codable model
let product = try response.decode(MyProduct.self)
```
