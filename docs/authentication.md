# Authentication

**Authentication** is how your application proves to the server who is making the request. Think of it like showing your ID at a store — the server needs to know whether you're a guest shopper, a registered customer, or a store admin, so it can show you the right cart and allow the right actions.

CoCart supports multiple authentication methods depending on the use case.

## Guest Customers

No authentication is needed for guest cart operations. A "guest" is someone shopping without logging in — just like browsing a physical store without a membership card. The SDK automatically manages the guest session for you:

1. **First request** — No cart key exists yet. The CoCart server creates a new guest session and returns a `Cart-Key` in the response. This is a unique string (like `guest_abc123`) that identifies this particular guest's cart.
2. **SDK extracts it** — The SDK reads the `Cart-Key` from the response and stores it automatically in the Keychain.
3. **Subsequent requests** — The stored cart key is sent with every request so the server knows which cart to look up.

```swift
import CoCart

let client = CoCart("https://your-store.com")

// Add item — cart key is captured from the response automatically
try await client.cart().addItem(123, quantity: 2)

print(client.cartKey) // Optional("guest_abc123...")

// Subsequent requests use the same cart
let cart = try await client.cart().get()
```

### Restoring a Session

Cart keys are automatically persisted to the Keychain. Call `restoreSession()` once on app launch to load the cart key:

```swift
let client = CoCart("https://your-store.com")

// Restore cart key from Keychain
try await client.restoreSession()

// Now the client has the persisted cart key
let cart = try await client.cart().get()
```

### Resuming with a Known Cart Key

If you already have a cart key, pass it directly:

```swift
let client = CoCart("https://your-store.com", options: CoCartOptions(
    cartKey: "existing_cart_key"
))
```

## Basic Auth

**Basic Authentication** is the simplest way to authenticate. It sends the username and password encoded in a header with every request. It's straightforward but should only be used over HTTPS (which encrypts the connection) to keep credentials safe.

For authenticated customers using WordPress username/password:

```swift
let client = CoCart("https://your-store.com", options: CoCartOptions(
    username: "customer@email.com",
    password: "customer_password"
))

// Or set at runtime
let client2 = CoCart("https://your-store.com")
client2.setAuth("customer@email.com", password: "password")

// Check auth status
client2.isAuthenticated // true
client2.isGuest         // false
```

## JWT Authentication

**JWT (JSON Web Token)** is a more secure authentication method. Instead of sending your password with every request, you log in once and receive a short-lived **token** — a long encoded string like `eyJhbGciOi...`. This token is sent with subsequent requests to prove your identity. When it expires, the SDK can automatically **refresh** it (get a new one) without asking the customer to log in again.

If the [CoCart JWT Authentication](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cocart-jwt-authentication/) plugin (v3.0+) is installed, `login()` acquires JWT tokens automatically. If the plugin is not installed, `login()` throws a `CoCartError.auth`. For stores without JWT, use Basic Auth directly via `setAuth()`.

### Login

```swift
import CoCart

let client = CoCart("https://your-store.com")

// Login via JWT (requires CoCart JWT Authentication plugin)
let response = try await client.login("customer@email.com", password: "password")

print(response.getString("display_name")) // Optional("john")
print(response.getString("user_id"))      // Optional("123")

// Subsequent requests automatically use the acquired credentials
let cart = try await client.cart().get()
```

### Logout

```swift
try await client.logout() // Calls server logout endpoint, then clears local JWT and refresh tokens
```

### Refresh an Expired Token

```swift
try await client.jwt().refresh()
```

### Validate a Token

```swift
if try await client.jwt().validate() {
    print("Token is valid")
} else {
    print("Token is expired or invalid")
}
```

### Check Token Expiry

JWT tokens have a built-in expiration time. You can check locally (without contacting the server) whether the token has expired:

```swift
// Check if expired (with 30-second leeway by default)
if client.jwt().isTokenExpired() {
    try await client.jwt().refresh()
}

// Custom leeway (e.g., refresh 5 minutes before expiry)
if client.jwt().isTokenExpired(leeway: 300) {
    try await client.jwt().refresh()
}

// Get the expiry timestamp
if let expiry = client.jwt().getTokenExpiry() {
    let date = Date(timeIntervalSince1970: expiry)
    print("Token expires at: \(date)")
}
```

### Auto-Refresh

The `withAutoRefresh` wrapper detects expired tokens behind the scenes, requests a new one using the refresh token, and retries the original request — all transparently. The customer never sees an error or gets logged out unexpectedly:

```swift
let result = try await client.jwt().withAutoRefresh {
    try await client.cart().get()
}
```

### JWT Utility Methods

```swift
client.jwt().hasTokens()            // true if a JWT token is set
client.jwt().isTokenExpired()        // true if token is expired (local check)
client.jwt().getTokenExpiry()        // unix timestamp of token expiry, or nil
client.jwt().isAutoRefreshEnabled()  // check auto-refresh status
client.jwt().setAutoRefresh(true)    // enable/disable at runtime
```

## Consumer Keys (Admin)

**Consumer keys** are API credentials generated in the WooCommerce admin panel (WooCommerce > Settings > Advanced > REST API). They are different from a customer's username/password — they're meant for server-to-server access and administrative operations like managing cart sessions.

For admin-only endpoints like the Sessions API, use WooCommerce REST API credentials:

```swift
let client = CoCart("https://your-store.com", options: CoCartOptions(
    consumerKey: "ck_xxxxx",
    consumerSecret: "cs_xxxxx"
))

let sessions = try await client.sessions().all()
```

## Custom Auth Header Name

HTTP requests include **headers** — metadata sent alongside your request. The `Authorization` header is the standard way to send credentials. However, some hosting providers or **reverse proxies** (servers that sit between your app and WordPress, like Cloudflare, Nginx, or Apache) strip or block this header for security reasons. If your authentication isn't working, this is a common cause.

You can configure the SDK to send credentials under a different header name:

```swift
let client = CoCart("https://your-store.com", options: CoCartOptions(
    authHeaderName: "X-Auth-Token",
    username: "customer@email.com",
    password: "password"
))
// Sends: X-Auth-Token: Basic <base64>
```

This works with all auth methods (Basic Auth, JWT, Consumer Keys):

```swift
// JWT with custom header
let client = CoCart("https://your-store.com", options: CoCartOptions(
    authHeaderName: "X-Auth-Token",
    jwtToken: "eyJ..."
))
// Sends: X-Auth-Token: Bearer eyJ...
```

You can also set it at runtime with the fluent setter:

```swift
let client = CoCart("https://your-store.com")
    .setAuthHeaderName("X-Auth-Token")
    .setAuth("user", password: "pass")
```

## Authentication Priority

If you accidentally configure multiple authentication methods at the same time (for example, both a JWT token and a username/password), the SDK uses this priority order to decide which one to send:

1. **JWT Token** (`jwtToken`) — Bearer token
2. **Basic Auth** (`username` / `password`) — Basic auth header
3. **Consumer Keys** (`consumerKey` / `consumerSecret`) — Basic auth header

### Switching Auth at Runtime

```swift
// Start with JWT
let client = CoCart("https://your-store.com", options: CoCartOptions(
    jwtToken: "eyJ..."
))

// Switch to Basic Auth (clears JWT)
client.setAuth("user", password: "pass")

// Switch to JWT (clears Basic Auth)
client.setJWTToken("new.jwt.token")

// Clear everything
try await client.clearSession()
```
